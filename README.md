# Intelligent Traffic Management System

A Java-based simulation of an intelligent traffic management system, designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.

# Description
The Intelligent Traffic Management System is a simulation-based project that aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas. The system uses a combination of algorithms and data structures to simulate traffic behavior and optimize traffic signal control. The project consists of several key components, including:

- Traffic Simulation: A grid-based model that simulates traffic behavior, taking into account factors such as traffic volume, speed, and direction.
- Traffic Signal Control: An optimization algorithm that adjusts traffic signal timings to minimize congestion and reduce travel times.
- Real-time Visualization: A graphical user interface that displays the traffic simulation in real-time, allowing users to visualize and interact with the system.
